- This capstone project completed during the Google Advanced Data Analytics course focuses on Salifort Motors' employee satisfaction levels.  It contains a **PACE strategy document** for the workflow of the project and a **Jupyter Notebook.**
- The HR department seeks data-driven insights to understand factors contributing to employee turnover. The project involved analyzing collected employee data and constructing a predictive model to determine the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.
- Data preprocessing and transformation were executed using the **Pandas library**, followed by the creation of interactive visualizations using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**. Two model approaches were implemented: **Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier**.
- The **Logistic Regression model** achieved a **precision of 79%, recall of 82%, F1-score of 80%, and accuracy of 82%**. However, the predictive scores for employees likely to leave were notably lower.
- The **Decision Tree model,** after parameter tuning, demonstrated an **accuracy of 98.1% and an F1-score of 94.3%**. The **Random Forest model** slightly outperformed the Decision Tree model. These findings informed recommendations for improving employee retention strategies at Salifort Motors.
